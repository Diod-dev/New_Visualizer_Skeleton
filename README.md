# New_Visualizer_Skeleton
This has everything required to start a new music-visualizer, and is designed for our hardware, whch is available for purchase on our Tindie store, at https://www.tindie.com/stores/diod_design/

ESP-32 code for hosting a webpage control panel has been added! Hopefully the comments in the .ino file can explain how everything works well enough. The 'data' folder gets uploaded to ESP32 through SPIFFS. The website randomnerdtutorials.com has great ESP32 webserver tutorials, which this is basd on.

More patterns and LED functions coming soon!

More info on how to use this code coming soon!
